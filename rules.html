                    a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                    adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older</li>

                    the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                    minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
